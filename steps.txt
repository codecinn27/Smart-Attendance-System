1) setup virtual environment for python 3.10

py -3.10 -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate

2) upgrade pip

python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip


3) Install torch from  
* make you have install cuda and cudnn 
    * ref: https://github.com/entbappy/Setup-NVIDIA-GPU-for-Deep-Learning
    * reference installing video
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krAUwYslS8E
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nATRPPZ5dGE
* reference from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch==2.2.2+cu118 torchvision==0.17.2+cu118 torchaudio==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118


4) test pytorch script in test_torch.py

5) run facenet-torch

https://kean-chan.medium.com/real-time-facial-recognition-with-pytorch-facenet-ca3f6a510816

just run this  (facenet_pytorch use torch 2.2 to 2.3)
pip install facenet_pytorch tqdm
dont pip install torch if you have install torch for gpu 


6) pip install opencv-python

7) run code

version 1: main2.py + saved
version 2: main3.py + saved2 + take_pic.py
version 3: dataset-creator.py -> trainer.py -> recognition.py 
    -> include (dataset , sqlite.db, embeddings.pkl)

8) Use sqlite instead of json for easy query and display
-> have 4 table
    -> student , class, enrollment, attendance 

    -> What does the enrollment table do?
        It stores which student is enrolled in which class.
        It typically has:

            enrollment_id (primary key, unique ID for each enrollment record)
            student_id (foreign key linking to the student)
            class_id (foreign key linking to the class)

        You can easily find all students in a specific class by querying enrollments with that classâ€™s ID.
        You can find all classes a specific student is enrolled in by querying enrollments with that studentâ€™s ID.
        Keeps your data normalized, avoids duplication.

-> 1st step: create .db with 4 tables
        run table_creation.py 

-> 2nd step: create dummy data to display in forms 
        run dummy_data.py

9) Get the data from the 4 table and display it at record.html

10) Get data from the form in enroll.html and save it into attendance.db and display it at record.html






## Future to add
1) display student details with image
2) /enroll before the webcam turn on have a progress bar loading 


## Steps to activate:
./env/Scripts/Activate
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
uvicorn app:app --reload

python ./database/reset_db.py
